# üìò Bash Scripting for Absolute Beginners

Welcome to your **first step into the world of Bash scripting!**
This guide is for anyone who knows how to use Linux and the terminal, but has *zero* experience with scripting or programming.

We'll go step by step, keeping things simple, clear, and practical.

---

## 1. üêö Introduction to Bash Scripting

### What is Bash?

Bash stands for **Bourne Again SHell**. It's the most common command-line shell used on Linux.
It's what you use when typing commands into the terminal.

### What is a Bash Script?

A Bash script is just a **text file** containing a series of Bash commands. Instead of typing each command manually, you save them in a file and run them all at once.

### Why Use Bash Scripts?

* Automate boring or repetitive tasks
* Run multiple commands together
* Build small tools and systems

### How to Run a Bash Script

1. Write your script in a file (e.g. `myscript.sh`)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x myscript.sh`
3. Run it: `./myscript.sh`

## 2. üñäÔ∏è First Script and Syntax Basics

### Your First Script

Create a file called `hello.sh` and write this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, world!"
```

### What is `#!/bin/bash`?

This is called a **shebang**. It tells Linux to run the script using Bash.

### The `echo` Command

`echo` is used to print text on the screen:

```bash
echo "Welcome to Bash!"
echo "Today's date is: $(date)"
```

## 3. üî¢ Variables and User Input

### Declaring Variables

```bash
name="Ramez"
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

Note: **No spaces** around `=` when assigning variables.

### Reading User Input

```bash
echo "What's your name?"
read username
echo "Nice to meet you, $username!"
```

### Quoting and Escaping

* Use `"double quotes"` when referencing variables.
* Use `\` to escape characters:

```bash
echo "He said: \"Hello\""
```

## 4. üîÅ Conditions and Logic

### if, else, elif

```bash
if [ $age -ge 18 ]; then
  echo "You're an adult."
elif [ $age -ge 13 ]; then
  echo "You're a teenager."
else
  echo "You're a child."
fi
```

### Comparison Operators

| Type    | Operator | Meaning        |
| ------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Numbers | `-eq`    | equal          |
|         | `-ne`    | not equal      |
|         | `-gt`    | greater than   |
|         | `-lt`    | less than      |
| Strings | `=`      | equal          |
|         | `!=`     | not equal      |
| Files   | `-f`     | is a file      |
|         | `-d`     | is a directory |

### `[[ ]]` vs `[ ]`

Both are used to test conditions. `[[ ]]` is newer and safer.

## 5. üîÇ Loops and Repetition

### for loop

```bash
for name in Ramez Sarah Ali; do
  echo "Hello $name"
done
```

### while loop

```bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
  echo "Count is $count"
  ((count++))
done
```

### break and continue

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
  if [ $i -eq 5 ]; then
    continue
  fi
  echo $i
  if [ $i -eq 8 ]; then
    break
  fi
done
```

## 6. üß© Functions in Bash

### Defining and Calling Functions

```bash
say_hello() {
  echo "Hello, $1!"
}

say_hello Ramez
```

### Return Values

```bash
add() {
  result=$(( $1 + $2 ))
  echo $result
}

sum=$(add 3 5)
echo "Sum is $sum"
```

## 7. üìÇ Working with Files and Directories

### Check if File or Directory Exists

```bash
if [ -f file.txt ]; then
  echo "File exists."
fi
```

### Read File Line by Line

```bash
while read line; do
  echo "Line: $line"
done < file.txt
```

### Create and Write to a File

```bash
echo "Hello" > file.txt   # overwrite
echo "World" >> file.txt  # append
```

## 8. üõ† Useful Bash Commands

| Command | What it Does                    |
| ------- | ------------------------------- |
| `cat`   | Shows contents of a file        |
| `grep`  | Searches for text in files      |
| `cut`   | Cuts sections of text           |
| `awk`   | Text processing (e.g. column 1) |
