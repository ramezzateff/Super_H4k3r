## üõ† Tools Used in Scripts

- `uname`, `hostname`, `whoami`, `id`  
- `ip`, `ifconfig` (optional)  
- `uptime`, `free`, `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo`  
- `printenv`, `top`, `htop`, `arch`, `lscpu`  

---

## üìé Notes

- Most scripts are safe and compatible with most Linux distros.  
- For live monitoring, make sure `top` or `htop` is installed.  
- You can run each script separately or combine them into one dashboard.  
- Don‚Äôt forget to make each script executable:  
  ```bash
  chmod +x scriptname.sh
