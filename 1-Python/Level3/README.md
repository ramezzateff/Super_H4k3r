## ðŸ”¥ Level 3: Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries

Welcome to Level 3 of our Python coding exercises! In this level, we will explore essential data structures: lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Understanding these will help you manage and manipulate data efficiently.

### Topics Covered
- Indexing and Iteration
- Dictionary Lookups
- List Manipulation
- Sorting and Filtering
- Working with Tuples and Dictionaries

### Exercises

1. **Create a list of hacker tools**
   - Create a list containing 10 common hacker tools (e.g., `['Nmap', 'Metasploit', 'Wireshark', ...]`).
   - **File Name:** `0_hacker_tools_list.py`

2. **Print a specific item from the list**
   - Print the third item from the hacker tools list.
   - **File Name:** `1_print_third_item.py`

3. **Dictionary of HTTP status codes**
   - Create a dictionary storing common HTTP status codes and their meanings (e.g., `{200: 'OK', 404: 'Not Found'}`).
   - **File Name:** `2_http_status_codes.py`

4. **Letter Frequency Counter**
   - Write a program that counts how many times each letter appears in a given string.
   - **File Name:** `3_letter_frequency.py`

5. **Sort a list without using `.sort()`**
   - Implement a sorting algorithm (like Bubble Sort) to sort a list of random numbers.
   - **File Name:** `4_custom_sort.py`

6. **Port and Service Lookup**
   - Store port numbers and their corresponding services in a dictionary and allow the user to query by port number.
   - **File Name:** `5_port_service_lookup.py`

7. **Remove duplicates from a list**
   - Write a function that removes duplicate values from a list.
   - **File Name:** `6_remove_duplicates.py`

8. **Convert a list into a comma-separated string**
   - Take a list and convert it into a single string, separating items with commas.
   - **File Name:** `7_list_to_string.py`

9. **Find the longest word in a list**
   - Given a list of words, determine which word is the longest.
   - **File Name:** `8_longest_word.py`

10. **Username and Password Lookup**
   - Given a dictionary of usernames and passwords, write a script that asks for a username and prints the stored password.
   - **File Name:** `9_user_password_lookup.py`
