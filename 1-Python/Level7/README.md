Python Automation

Web Scraping

Encryption & Obfuscation

Packet Capture & Analysis

Phishing Simulation

Metadata & OSINT

Ethical Scripting Practices

üöÄ Exercises Overview
Generate Fake Email Addresses
Generate 10 fake but realistic-looking email addresses.

File Name: 0_fake_emails.py

Caesar Cipher Tool
Simulate a Caesar cipher tool that can both encrypt and decrypt text.

File Name: 1_caesar_cipher.py

Webpage Link Scraper (BeautifulSoup)
Build a script that extracts all hyperlinks from a given webpage using BeautifulSoup.

File Name: 2_scrape_links.py

Simple Keylogger
Create a simple keylogger that logs user keystrokes to a file (for ethical/local use only).

File Name: 3_keylogger.py

Website Status Checker
Write a script that checks whether a website is online or down.

File Name: 4_check_website.py

Image Metadata Extractor
Build a tool that extracts metadata (like EXIF) from image files.

Basic Packet Sniffer
Create a simple packet sniffer that captures network traffic (e.g., using scapy or socket).

File Name: 7_packet_sniffer.py

Fake Credit Card Generator
Write a script that generates fake credit card numbers for testing payment fields (Luhn algorithm optional).

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
These projects are for educational and ethical purposes only.

Don‚Äôt test any of these scripts on systems you don‚Äôt own or have permission to use.

Tools like keyloggers, sniffers, and DDoS simulators must be handled responsibly and locally.
