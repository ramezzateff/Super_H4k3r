## üéØ Real-World Cybersecurity Use Case

You're developing a **modular brute-force engine** that supports brute-forcing different protocols like SSH, FTP, and HTTP logins.

Each module must implement its own way to brute-force, but all should follow the same interface (e.g., a `.run()` method).  
This is where **polymorphism** helps you write tools that are easy to extend and maintain.

## üíª Python Code ‚Äì BruteForcer Interface Example

```python
class BruteForcer:
    def run(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement the run method.")


class SSHBruteForcer(BruteForcer):
    def run(self):
        print("[SSH] Trying credentials on port 22...")


class FTPBruteForcer(BruteForcer):
    def run(self):
        print("[FTP] Trying credentials on port 21...")


class HTTPBruteForcer(BruteForcer):
    def run(self):
        print("[HTTP] Sending POST requests to login endpoint...")


# Generic function that takes any brute forcer
def execute_brute_force(tool: BruteForcer):
    tool.run()


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    brute_tools = [SSHBruteForcer(), FTPBruteForcer(), HTTPBruteForcer()]

    for tool in brute_tools:
        execute_brute_force(tool)
```

## üìò Concept Explanation
What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism means many forms ‚Äî different classes can define the same method (like run()), and you can call them in a generic way.
    - Each brute-forcer tool implements its own `run()` method.
    - But you can loop over all tools and just call `.run()` without caring which type they are.

This leads to cleaner code, where you don‚Äôt have to write separate logic for each tool.

---

## üõ† Offensive Security Application
You‚Äôll use polymorphism when building tools like:
- Credential brute-forcers for multiple protocols
- Payload generators with different formats (Base64, URL encode, Hex)
- Output formatters (JSON, CSV, HTML)

Instead of writing if tool_type == 'ssh':, just use .run() and let polymorphism do the rest.

---

##üîê Connection to SOLID

‚úÖ Open/Closed Principle: You can add a new brute-forcer (e.g., RDP) by just adding a new class.
No changes to existing logic.

‚úÖ Liskov Substitution Principle: You can use any subclass in place of the parent (`BruteForcer`) without breaking the code.

---

## ‚úÖ Exercises / Next Steps
1. Add a `MySQLBruteForcer` that inherits from `BruteForcer` and prints a fake login attempt.
2. Modify `execute_brute_force()` to include a delay or log time taken by each tool.
3. Create a generic `Reporter` class with polymorphic `output()` methods (for JSON, plaintext, etc.).
