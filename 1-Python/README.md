# Cybersecurity Learning Journey - 2025

## Introduction
Welcome to your Cybersecurity Learning Journey! ðŸš€
These exercises are designed to help you build fundamental skills in cybersecurity and programming. The challenges range from beginner-friendly tasks to advanced hacking simulations.

## Learning Plan
This journey follows a structured weekly learning plan. Each week, you'll master a new skill and complete corresponding exercises. The levels are designed to reinforce your knowledge and gradually introduce you to more advanced topics.

## How to Use This Repository
1. Watch the associated video for each topic before attempting the exercises.
2. Solve the exercises in order, starting from Level 1.
3. Research and experiment where necessaryâ€”self-learning is crucial in cybersecurity!
4. Avoid copying solutions directly; the goal is to learn, not just complete tasks.
5. After completing the exercises, compare your solutions with shared solutions.

## Rules for Problem Solving
1. **Google first** - Always try to find the answer yourself before seeking help.
2. **Use ChatGPT wisely** - Ask for clarifications, not direct solutions.
3. **No copy-pasting solutions** - If you do, youâ€™re missing out on the learning process!

## Tools & Resources
- Python 3.x
- Cybersecurity toolkits (Nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite, etc.)
- Online CTF platforms (Hack The Box, TryHackMe)
- Documentation and cybersecurity blogs
