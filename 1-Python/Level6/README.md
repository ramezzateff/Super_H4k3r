üî• Level 6: Networking & Sockets
Welcome to Level 6 of our Python cybersecurity journey! In this level, we explore how to interact with networks using Python. You‚Äôll work with IP addresses, ports, sockets, HTTP requests, and simple scripts that help you understand real-world networking concepts.

üü¢ Topics Covered
IP Addressing (Public & Private)

Port Scanning

HTTP Requests and Headers

Basic Socket Programming

Network Discovery

Host and Website Availability

Brute-forcing and Automation Basics

üöÄ Exercises Overview
Fetch Public IP Address
Write a script that fetches and prints your public IP address using an external API.

File Name: 0_fetch_public_ip.py

Scan Ports Using Sockets
Use Python‚Äôs socket module to scan for open ports (range 20-100) on scanme.nmap.org.

File Name: 1_port_scanner.py

Send HTTP Request & Print Headers
Write a script that sends an HTTP GET request to example.com and prints the response headers.

File Name: 2_http_headers.py

Client-Server Program (Sockets)
Create a simple Python program with a client and a server that communicate over TCP sockets.

File Name: 3_client_server.py

Resolve Domain to IP Address
Write a program that takes a domain name and resolves it to an IP address.

File Name: 4_resolve_domain.py

Send Fake HTTP Headers
Create a program that mimics different browser user-agents by sending fake headers in a request.

File Name: 5_fake_headers.py

Website Availability Checker
Write a script that checks whether a website is online or down.

File Name: 6_website_status.py

Find Live Hosts on Local Network
Implement a script that pings all IPs in a local subnet to find live hosts.

File Name: 7_find_live_hosts.py

Ping List of IPs and Report Status
Write a script that takes a list of IP addresses and pings each one, reporting whether they are reachable.

File Name: 8_ping_list.py

Brute-force a Login Page
Use Python to try different passwords from a wordlist on a login page.

File Name: 9_brute_force_login.py

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
Some scripts may require admin/root privileges (especially ping or network scan tasks).

Always use ethical practices. Do not run brute-force or scanning tools on systems without permission.

Use scanme.nmap.org for port scanning because it's legally permitted for educational purposes.
