## üîπ Exercises

Each task is paired with its own dedicated Python file to help keep everything organized.

‚úÖ 1. Validate IP Address Format:
- Description: Write a script that checks whether a given IP address is in IPv4 or IPv6 format.
- File: `0_validate_ip.py`

‚úÖ 2. IPv4 to Binary:
- Description: Convert an IPv4 address from dotted-decimal to binary.
- File: `1_ipv4_to_binary.py`

‚úÖ 3. Extract IPs from File:
- Description: Scan a text file and extract all IP addresses found.
- File: `2_extract_ips.py`

‚úÖ 4. Check Private IP:
- Description: Write a function to check if an IP belongs to a private network (e.g., 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x).
- File: `3_check_private_ip.py`

‚úÖ 5. Network & Broadcast Address:
- Description: Given an IP and subnet mask, calculate the network and broadcast addresses.
- File: `4_network_and_broadcast.py`

‚úÖ 6. Generate Subnet IPs:
- Description: Generate all possible IPs within a subnet like 192.168.1.0/24.
- File: `5_generate_ips.py`

‚úÖ 7. Ping an IP Address:
- Description: Script to ping an IP and check its availability.
- File: `6_ping_ip.py`

‚úÖ 8. IPv6 Conversion:
- Description: Convert an IPv6 address into its compressed and expanded forms.
- File: `7_ipv6_conversion.py`

‚úÖ 9. Determine IPv4 Class:
-Description: Function that returns the class (A, B, C, D, E) of a given IPv4 address.
- File: `8_ipv4_class.py`

‚úÖ 10. Check Same Subnet:
Description: Given two IPs, determine whether they belong to the same subnet.
- File: `9_same_subnet.py`
