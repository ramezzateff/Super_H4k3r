# üî• Day 1: IP Addresses & Subnetting

Welcome to Day 1 of our networking and Python scripting journey! This day focuses on understanding IP addresses, subnetting, and the basics of networking protocols.

## Topics Covered
- IP Basics (IPv4 & IPv6)
- Subnetting & CIDR Notation
- Network Calculations

## üîπ Exercises

1. Write a Python script that validates whether a given IP address is IPv4 or IPv6.
   - **File Name:** `0_validate_ip.py`

2. Convert an IPv4 address from dotted-decimal to binary format.
   - **File Name:** `1_ipv4_to_binary.py`

3. Extract all IP addresses from a text file.
   - **File Name:** `2_extract_ips.py`

4. Write a function that checks if an IP belongs to a private network (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, etc.).
   - **File Name:** `3_check_private_ip.py`

5. Given an IP and subnet mask, calculate the network address and broadcast address.
   - **File Name:** `4_network_and_broadcast.py`

6. Generate a list of all possible IPs in a given subnet (192.168.1.0/24).
   - **File Name:** `5_generate_ips.py`

7. Create a script that checks if an IP is reachable by pinging it.
   - **File Name:** `6_ping_ip.py`

8. Convert an IPv6 address to its compressed and expanded forms.
   - **File Name:** `7_ipv6_conversion.py`

9. Write a function that determines the class of an IPv4 address (A, B, C, D, E).
   - **File Name:** `8_ipv4_class.py`

10. Given two IPs, determine if they belong to the same subnet.
   - **File Name:** `9_same_subnet.py`
