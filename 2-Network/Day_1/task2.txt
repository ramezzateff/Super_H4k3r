The internal systems were recently updated, and several machines were reassigned new IP addresses. For example, the web server now uses 192.168.1.10, while the database server has been moved to 10.0.0.5. Our VPN gateway still points to 172.16.0.1, and a new DNS backup server is configured with 8.8.8.8. Be sure to avoid traffic through the old node at 192.168.100.100, which is no longer in use.
